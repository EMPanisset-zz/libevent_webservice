INSTALLING DEPENDENCIES 

In order to build Tigera webserver commands below should be executed in the parent
directory of webservice:

sudo apt-get install autogen automake autotools-dev autoconf libtool

./install_dependencies

BUILDING

In the webservice directory execute:

make clean; make

EXECUTING

binary file "tigera_webservice" should be created in the challenge1 directory.

You can start server by specifying local address and local port to bind,
as well as number of worker threads:

./tigera_webserver -a <address> -p <port> -n <number of workers> -d <turns into a daemon> -r <dnsserver ip:port>

default values are respectivelly "127.0.0.1" (localhost), 5000, 4, no daemon, and "8.8.8.8:53"

Note: You would need to be root to be able to open low ports (below 1024).

ARCHITECUTRE

This http server is a multi-threaded asynchronous service based on largely used and scalable libevent library.

The service starts a configurable number of threads (this number should be proportional to the number of host
processors), listening to the same TCP port and running on their own libevent loop.

Accepting sockets are load balanced among listening threads by Linux kernel in an efficient manner by making setting
listening sockets with SO_REUSEPORT socket option (please see this article for details https://lwn.net/Articles/542629/)

BOTTLENECKS OF THIS SOLUTION

Sessions were stored in a list instead of in a hashtable to allow us gracefully stop service by removing
all session currently being processed. This list introduces O(n) processing time whenever sessions are destroyed
during service execution. By usign a hashtable and tracking session by 5-tuple fields
(src addr, src port, dst addr, dst port, proto) whe would reduce this running time to O(1).

Scalability could also be addressed by making service run on additional nodes in the system and partitioning
users by using distributed hash tables.
